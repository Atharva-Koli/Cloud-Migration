# 🚀 Cloud-Native Migration of Legacy 3-Tier Application

> A complete DevOps project transforming a monolithic on-premise application into a scalable, cost-optimized, and fully automated cloud-native infrastructure on AWS using Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was executed as part of a 6-month DevOps internship at **Hisan Labs (Cloudblitz subsidiary)**. The objective was to **migrate a legacy 3-tier web application** (frontend, backend, and database) to a **cloud-native architecture** using modern DevOps tools and best practices.

The outcome was a fully containerized, orchestrated, and CI/CD-enabled application hosted on AWS, backed by Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and extensive automation.
