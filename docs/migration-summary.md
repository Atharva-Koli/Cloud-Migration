# 🧭 Cloud Migration Project – Summary

This project demonstrates the migration of a traditional 3-tier application into a modern cloud-native architecture on AWS.

## 🏗️ Objective

To migrate a monolithic web app to a scalable, secure, and cost-effective architecture using:
- Terraform (IaC)
- EKS (App Tier)
- RDS (DB Tier)
- S3 (Static Assets / Logs)
- CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- 3-tier cloud-native setup across multiple AZs
- 70% reduction in deployment time via automation
- Siloed architecture with VPC, subnets, NAT, IGW
- Production-ready with IAM, SGs, endpoints, and monitoring
